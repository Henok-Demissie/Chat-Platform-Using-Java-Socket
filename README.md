**Chat-Platform-Using-Java-Socket**
Overview
The Chat-Platform-Using-Java-Socket is a simple real-time chat platform implemented using Java Sockets. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages, creating a chatroom-like environment. The platform supports public messaging, where messages are broadcast to all clients connected to the server, as well as private messaging, where messages can be sent from one client to another directly.

This platform provides a lightweight and efficient way to implement a basic communication system between users using Java's Socket and ServerSocket classes. It offers both a server-side component, which handles client connections and message routing, and a client-side component, where users can interact with the chatroom interface.

Features
Real-time Communication: Clients can send and receive messages instantly in real time.
Public Messaging: Messages are broadcast to all connected clients in the chatroom.
Private Messaging: Clients can send messages directly to one specific client.
Multiple Clients: Supports simultaneous connections from multiple clients.
Simple User Interface: The client has a basic console-based interface for easy interaction.
Requirements
Java 8 or later
JDK installed on your machine
How to Set Up the Project
**1. Clone the Repository**
First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chat-Platform-Using-Java-Socket.git
**2. Compile the Code**
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt. The project contains two main components: the server and the client.

Server: Manages incoming connections and handles message distribution.
Client: Sends and receives messages.
To compile the code, open a terminal in the project directory and run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
javac Server.java
javac Client.java
This will compile the necessary Java files.

**3. Running the Server**
Run the server-side program. The server listens for incoming client connections and processes messages.

bash
Copy code
java Server
Once the server is running, it will display a message indicating that it is waiting for client connections.

**4. Running the Client**
In a new terminal window, run the client-side program to start a client instance. You can run as many clients as you like from different terminals or machines.

bash
Copy code
java Client
Each client will prompt for a username and allow you to send messages. The client will also display messages received from other clients.

**5. Communication Between Clients**
Public Messages: Any message typed by a client will be broadcast to all connected clients.
Private Messages: To send a private message to a specific client, type the command @username message, where username is the target client's name.
**6. Stopping the Server**
To stop the server, press CTRL + C in the terminal where the server is running.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

arduino

├── Server.java           # Main server code
├── Client.java           # Client code
└── README.md            # Documentation file
Server.java
This file contains the server logic for handling client connections and distributing messages. It uses Java ServerSocket to accept incoming client connections and Socket for communication with clients.

Accepting Clients: The server listens for incoming connections and assigns each new connection a thread for handling.
Broadcasting Messages: The server will broadcast any public messages to all connected clients.
Private Messaging: If a client sends a private message, the server checks for the target user and forwards the message accordingly.
Client.java
This file contains the client-side logic that allows a user to interact with the chat server. It includes:

**Connecting to the Server:** The client connects to the server using the Socket class.
**Message Sending:** The client can type messages, which are sent to the server for broadcasting to other clients.
**Receiving Messages:** The client listens for incoming messages from the server and displays them on the console.

**Key Concepts**
**1. Sockets and ServerSockets**
Java's Socket class is used to create connections between clients and the server. The ServerSocket class is used on the server side to listen for incoming client connections.

The server creates a ServerSocket instance and listens for client requests.
Once a client connects, a new Socket object is created for communication between the client and the server.

**2. Multi-threading**
The server uses multithreading to allow multiple clients to connect and communicate simultaneously. Each client is handled in a separate thread, allowing the server to interact with multiple clients at the same time.

**3. Message Broadcasting and Routing**
Messages are routed by the server. Public messages are broadcast to all clients, while private messages are routed to the specified client.

Potential Enhancements
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implement a GUI using JavaFX or Swing for a better user experience.
Authentication: Add basic authentication to require users to log in before sending messages.
File Sharing: Allow clients to send files or images through the chat.
Improved Error Handling: Add error handling for scenarios such as client disconnection or invalid inputs.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how to implement a basic chat platform using Java's Socket and ServerSocket classes. It provides both public and private messaging functionality and supports real-time communication between multiple clients. The system can be expanded to include more advanced features like authentication, file sharing, and a GUI for enhanced usability.
